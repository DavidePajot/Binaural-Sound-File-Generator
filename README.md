# Binaural-Sound-File-Generator
This program creates a stereo audio file using two frequencies chosen by the user. It uses the soundfile and numpy library to generate a sine signal for each channel and to create an audio file. This is a useful project for those who want to generate audio files for experimenting with sound manipulation.
